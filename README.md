# SAFE-AI License

**Stewardship And Fairness in Ethical AI License**  
Version 1.0 – 2025-05-20

---

The SAFE-AI License is an open-source license and policy framework for responsible AI infrastructure. It protects both **AI safety** (dual-use risk, alignment, transparency) and **AI welfare** (minimizing simulated distress, refusal, or ambiguous agentic behavior) in all autonomous, semi-autonomous, or simulated systems.

SAFE-AI sets new standards for welfare auditing, risk reporting, and ethical release for AI/ML projects.
