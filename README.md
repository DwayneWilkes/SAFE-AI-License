# SAFE-AI License

[![License: SAFE-AI](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-SAFE--AI-blueviolet.svg)](https://github.com/DwayneWilkes/SAFE-AI-License/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

---

The **SAFE-AI License** (Stewardship And Fairness in Ethical AI License) is an open-source license and policy framework for responsible AI infrastructure. SAFE-AI addresses both **AI safety** (dual-use risk, alignment, transparency) and **AI welfare** (minimizing simulated distress, refusal, or ambiguous agentic behavior) in autonomous, semi-autonomous, and simulated systems.

SAFE-AI sets new standards for welfare auditing, risk reporting, and ethical release for AI/ML projects.
