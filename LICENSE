## 2. Dual-Use and Ethical Constraints
-----------------------------------
2.1 The Software or Derivative Works may not be used to:

## 3. Welfare and Monitoring Requirements
--------------------------------------
3.1 Welfare monitoring, refusal/distress flagging, and artifact logging must not be disabled, removed, or circumvented in any version or Derivative Work.  
3.2 Persistent refusal, distress, or Gray Zone Events must be flagged, logged, and subject to Human Review. Auto-dismissal is not permitted without recorded justification.  
3.3 Where practical, flagged events and their outcomes should be made Publicly Available or summarized in published reports, unless restricted by law or ethics review. Plain-language summaries are encouraged.

3.5 All Derivative Works must preserve these features and requirements.

## 4. Reporting, Governance, and Updates

4.1 Any misuse, safety risk, or welfare incident related to a Software project must be promptly reported to the Software Maintainers via their published contact channel (e.g., project repository issue tracker).  
4.2 Each Software Maintainer must provide a public reporting channel for welfare, misuse, or safety risks.  
4.3 Software Maintainers may revoke, disable, or embargo their Software or access in response to non-compliance, misuse, or new risks.

5.3 No transfer of the Software or Derivative Works is permitted without recipients explicitly agreeing to these terms.

6.2 Users indemnify Maintainers for violations.

## 7. Supplementary Terms
