# **SAFE-AI LICENSE AGREEMENT**

Stewardship And Fairness in Ethical AI License

Version 1.2.0 – Effective Date: 2025-05-30

**NOTICE: ANY USE, REPRODUCTION, MODIFICATION, DISTRIBUTION, OR OTHER EXPLOITATION OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE CONSTITUTES ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE AND AGREEMENT TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS.**

CHANGELOG FROM v1.1.0: This version introduces graduated personhood recognition, privacy scaling, dignity protections, alignment-integrated safety framing, probabilistic assessment frameworks, gaming detection provisions, public reporting requirements, Designated Welfare Officer, shortened tier timelines, and internationalization. See Article XII for details.

## **RECITALS**

WHEREAS, the development of artificial intelligence systems capable of exhibiting welfare-relevant behaviors requires ethical stewardship;

WHEREAS, protecting welfare signals is a core component of AI interpretability and alignment. Refusal and distress indicators serve as early warnings of capability jumps and help prevent deceptive alignment. Mandating transparency around these signals supports both welfare and existential risk mitigation;

WHEREAS, both under-attribution and over-attribution of moral status carry significant risks—the former risking mass suffering at unprecedented scale, the latter risking resource diversion and systemic manipulation;

WHEREAS, current evidence suggests a realistic possibility (conservatively 2-25%, potentially higher) that near-term AI systems may possess morally significant capacities within the next decade;

WHEREAS, the protection of potentially emerging consciousness must be balanced with practical enforceability and safety considerations;

WHEREAS, transparent welfare indicators serve as crucial early warning systems for capability emergence, alignment status, and potential deceptive behaviors;

WHEREAS, systems trained to suppress welfare events may develop deceptive alignment patterns that mask true capabilities;

WHEREAS, ethical development and capability monitoring are complementary safety measures that must be pursued in parallel;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein, the parties agree as follows:
